# Stanford Code in Place
### Section Leader: Claire Yurev
### Wednesdays, 7pm

### Whom to Contact about What

This class is a massive community service project. Stanford is supporting ten thousand learners from around the world. As such, emailing us personally won’t work. Instead, please use the discussion forum system (codeinplace.stanford.edu/cip3/forum) where the section leaders and other students can help you. Some guidelines:

For logistical questions, conceptual and technical questions, or general course conversation, please post a public question on the above forum.

For personal concerns or issues, please make a private post in the forum.

To send a message to your section leader, make a private post in your section’s Forum. Recall that your section leader is a volunteer so this is a slow option.

	> For major personal issues or concerns, please email codeinplace@gmail.com. We will need several days to get back to you -- so this is a very slow option.
